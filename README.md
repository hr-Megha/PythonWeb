app = Flask(__name__)
Flask is the main class from the Flask module.

__name__ is a special Python variable that holds the name of the current file/module.

When you pass __name__ to Flask, it tells Flask:

‚ÄúHey, this file is the starting point of the application.‚Äù
This helps Flask know where to:

Look for HTML templates (templates/)

Load static files (like CSS/JS)

Handle routing properly
üß† Example:
If your file is called app.py, then __name__ will be "__main__" when you run it directly.
if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(debug=True)
This ensures the Flask server runs only when you execute the script directly

If someone imports your Flask file as a module in another script, it won‚Äôt auto-run

üî• app.run(debug=True):
Starts the Flask development web server
